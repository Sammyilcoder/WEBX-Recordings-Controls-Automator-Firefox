This firefox extension is based on the original Webex Recordings Controls Automator by Andrea Carpi, with modifications for Firefox compatibility and additional features.

# WEBX-Recordings-Controls-Automator
Use your keyboard arrows to forward, rewind and to modify the playback speed of Webex recordings.
What this extension aids with is a more customizable playback experience, allowing you to specify how much to speed up or slow down the video, and the percentage of speed change.
It overrides the default playback controls of Webex recordings, allowing you to specify, by opening the extension options page, how much to speed up or slow down the video, and the percentage of speed change.

This can allow for a more enjoyable experience trying to catch up with all the recording for an exam the day before!

This extension is compatible with Webex recordings, and it only works on Firefox.
