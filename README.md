# WEBX-Recordings-Controls-Automator
This firefox extension is based on the original Webex Recordings Controls Automator by Andrea Carpi, with modifications for Firefox compatibility and additional features.

This is the link to the original project: https://github.com/andreacarpibomber/WEBX-Recordings-Controls-Automator.
I would like to greatly thank Andrea for his work on the original project, which helped me a lot during my early stay at Politecnico when Webex did not natively implement these shortcuts.
With this extension I would like to continue his work, making it compatible with Firefox and adding some new features to make it more useful for the modern state of Webex.

# Features
Use your keyboard arrows to forward, rewind and to modify the playback speed of Webex recordings.
What this extension aids with is a more customizable playback experience, allowing you to specify how much to speed up or slow down the video, and the percentage of speed change.
It overrides the default playback controls of Webex recordings, allowing you to specify, by opening the extension options page, how much to speed up or slow down the video, and the percentage of speed change.

You can use the following keys to control the playback of Webex recordings:
- **Left Arrow**: Rewind the video by the specified amount of seconds.
- **Right Arrow**: Forward the video by the specified amount of seconds.
- **Up Arrow**: Increase the playback speed by the specified percentage.
- **Down Arrow**: Decrease the playback speed by the specified percentage.

_This can allow for a more enjoyable experience trying to catch up with all the recordings the day before an exam!_

# Installation
For Firefox users, this extension is available on the Firefox Add-ons page.
To install the extension, just add the extension to Firefox from the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/webx-recordings-control/).

Chrome version will be available soon, I am uploading it to the Chrome Web Store in the next few days.
